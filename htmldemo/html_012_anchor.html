      Swedish Academy of Sciences; Member of the Nobel Committee for Physics, 10
      December 2022. Your Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses, Esteemed Nobel Prize
      Laureates, Ladies and Gentlemen This year’s Nobel Prize in Physics is
      dedicated to quantum mechanics. Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr and Erwin
      Schrödinger all thought about quantum mechanics in 1935. Einstein
      challenged quantum mechanics and argued that although correct, it was not
      a complete theory. He thought there must be an underlying structure to
      quantum mechanics that so far had not revealed itself. Bohr, on the other
      hand, defended the theory and argued that it was complete. Finally,
      Schrödinger concluded that entanglement between two particles with a
      common past was the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics. Most
      physicists sided with Bohr and noted Schrödinger’s characterisation of
      entanglement, but mostly they were not that interested. They were too busy
      applying quantum mechanics to real world problems, both of fundamental
      character and for practical applications. Several of these practitioners
      of quantum mechanics would eventually receive the Nobel Prize in Physics
      and many of the things we today take for granted, such as streamed
      television, fast internet, mobile phones, and a plethora of medical
      diagnostics tools, all have their origins in quantum mechanics. Indeed,
      the laureates of 2020 and 2021 − Roger Penrose, Reinhard Genzel, Andrea
      Ghez, Syukuro Manabe, Klaus Hasselmann and Giorgio Parisi − are no
      exceptions. While the world moved on, a few physicists continued to think
      about the foundations of quantum mechanics. In 1964, John Stewart Bell
      invented a mathematical formula, Bell’s inequality, which pointed to a way
      to experimentally resolve the conflict between Einstein and Bohr. Most
      physicists did not pay attention. Why bother with a foundational problem
      of quantum mechanics that would have no practical consequences? From their
      perspective, the theory worked. It had been well established in textbooks
      and taught at universities for decades. Although it was recognised that
      quantum entanglement was an elusive and hard-to-understand trait of
      quantum mechanics, few realised what it could be used for. John Clauser
      was of a different opinion. When he heard about Bell’s inequality, he
      became obsessed with how to experimentally test it. He left his main
      research direction and, working with a younger colleague named Stuart
      Freedman, managed to perform the very first experimental test of Bell’s
      inequality. Their experimental effort fifty years ago, done on a
      shoestring budget, showed that quantum mechanics violated Bell’s
      inequality and that quantum mechanics correctly predicted the outcome of
      their experiment. Sadly, neither Bell nor Freedman is still with us today.
      John Clauser’s experiment appeared convincing and suggested that Bohr was
      more correct than Einstein. But Bell realised that there were a few
      shortcomings in Clauser’s experiment, shortcomings that seemed almost
      impossible to overcome. It is now that Alain Aspect entered the scene.
      Together with colleagues in France, he managed to overcome these
      shortcomings and performed a series of experiments that were broadly
      recognised. These experiments were even highlighted in Swedish newspapers,
      though sometimes stretched well beyond their actual results. The
      experimental test of Bell’s inequality now entered a new era, t
